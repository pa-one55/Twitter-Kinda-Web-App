app desc :  
    - we'll create users
    - users can write post

functions : 
    - login, logout, register
    - post creation
    - post like
    - post delete ( only to the owner )


packages : 
    express
    mongoose
    bcrypt 
    jsonwebtoken 
    cookie-parser
    ejs



extra :
- added error handling - wrong entries in the form, empty fields and all
- handeled the case when user directly tries to access the profile page
   - in this case there is no cookie to begin with 
   - so just added that case
- added 'register' button on login page, in case a new user comes directly at the login page
- added login on register page
- added delete a post feature

issue faced : 
    - the post was showing in my DB, but the post array in the userProfile was empty
    - wrong syntaxt -> <% user.username %>
    correct syntaxt -> <%= user.username %>
    forgot to put that `=` sign
